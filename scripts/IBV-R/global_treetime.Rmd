```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

```



```{r }

# Install artyfarty via github
devtools::install_github('datarootsio/artyfarty')

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
